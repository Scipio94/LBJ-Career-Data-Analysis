A trend in basketball has emerged in which the three pointer has become more important and prevalent in basketball, both in the NBA and internationally. The same trend is evident in LeBron's shot selection of two point and three point field goal attempts throughout his career. There has been a steady decline in the amount of two point field goals and an increase in three point field goal attempts as his career has progressed. Additionally, he's become more of a facilitator with an upward trend in assists per game throughout his career.
